Steps to duplicate in your system. 

1. Clone the repo.
2. Use the requirements.txt file to set up environment in your system. 
3. In your terminal, run the app.py file using "streamlit run app.py" file

The yaml file in the repo is just a sample that is meant to show the structure of the configuration because the plotting code uses this structure. 

Some future improvements. 
- Add feature to increase hdf5 size limit to greater than 200MB.
